This app pulls users' fitness data and makes comparisons to determine a winner and sets fitness challenges/competitions amongst users to compete in: first to run 20 miles in a week, fastest mile of the week, and most calories burned in a day. Users agree on the amount of money to be donated before a challenge through a user requesting another user. The loser of the challenge has to donate the agreed amount to the winner's charity of choice. Our reach goals are to have a second charity competition where users challenge each other on who can raise the most money for a charity firstâ€“the person who loses the challenge has to complete a fitness challenge. Also, we would like to implement payment processes such as stripe or google pay for donating money to charities. Our motivation is to encourage fitness amongst people while also contributing to larger causes through donations. The types of people who would want to use this application are runners (beginner to advanced), people who are interested in health & fitness, and people who are interested in raising money for social causes. The Nike Run Club App tracks runs, has Nike-led running pledges, and has a community of runners. Our idea differs from other running apps because the users are composed of everyday people who want to customize fitness challenges with friends. Also, the person who wins the challenge selects a charity for the loser of the challenge to donate a customized amount to. 

User-Types:
  Athletes: They can be beginner to advanced, anyone would be able to join the app and start challenges.
  Marathon runners: Those that are preparing to run marathons can use the app to motivate themselves to run more and prepare.
  Clubs & classes: It can be used as a platform for local running clubs and classes/programs to help keep track of their members' running activities.
